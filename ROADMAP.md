# ACIM Project Roadmap 🚀

This document outlines the future of the ACIM controller application. Our mission is to provide the world's lowest latency (0.03ms) controller software while remaining free and open-source.

## 🎯 Active Goals
### 🎮 Xbox Elite Series 2 Support
**Status:** [FUNDING IN PROGRESS]
**Target:** $180
We are currently raising funds via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/controllerlab/tip) to acquire an Xbox Elite Series 2. This will allow us to map the 4-paddle system and optimize polling rates to match our PS5 performance.
